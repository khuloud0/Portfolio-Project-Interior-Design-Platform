# Project Charter – Interior Design Platform

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a lightweight interior design platform that enables users to instantly generate personalized room design suggestions based on structured inputs such as room type, size, style, and color preferences
## Project Objectives
1. To develop a functional MVP that generates interior design suggestions based on at least 4 user input parameters by the end of the project timeline.
2. To ensure users can receive 2–4 design recommendations in under 30 seconds without requiring initial login.
3. To implement a scalable database containing at least 30 predefined interior design templates for accurate matching and filtering.

## Stakeholders

### Internal Stakeholders:
- Project Team (Students / Developers).
They are the individuals responsible for building and developing the platform, including programming, design, and system implementation.


### External Stakeholders:
External stakeholders include the current target users of the platform as well as potential future users as the system scales and evolves.

### 1️⃣ Current Target Users (Homeowners / Renters / Students)
These are the **primary users** of the platform who require quick, efficient, and simple interior design suggestions tailored to personal living spaces.
* **Homeowners:** Looking to refresh their permanent living areas with minimal effort.
* **Renters:** Seeking flexible and non-permanent design ideas for leased spaces.
* **Students:** Focused on practical, budget-friendly, and functional room setups for study or dorm life.

### 2️⃣ Future Users (Scalability Segment)
These represent the **potential growth sectors** for future versions of the platform, extending the tool's capabilities to professional and larger-scale environments.
* **Commercial Space Owners:** Small business owners, café managers, or boutique retailers.
* **Offices:** Corporate teams looking to optimize workplace ergonomics and aesthetics.
* **Large-scale Clients:** Interior design clients requiring coordination for expansive or multi-room environments.

### Team role & Responsibilites:
| Team Member | Role | Key Responsibilities |

| **Raghad Nassef** | Frontend Lead | Building the website interface and implementing the frontend experience. |
| **Layan Aldosari** | QA Lead | Testing, reviewing functionality, and ensuring quality and usability. |
| **Banan Aleid** | Database Lead & Project Manager | Database design and schema structure. Leading planning, task allocation, and cross-team coordination to ensure MVP delivery. |

### Description of the project’s scope
  
| Feature Category | In-Scope (Included) | Out-of-Scope (Excluded) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Interaction** | • User input form (room type, size, style, color preference)<br>• Progressive authentication (save-to-signup flow)<br>• User dashboard for saved designs | • Room image upload or scanning<br>• Advanced personalization algorithms |
| **Core Functionality** | • Template-based interior design suggestion system<br>• Display 2–4 design outputs per request<br>• Save Design functionality | • AI-generated interior design models<br>• 3D visualization or rendering |
| **Data & Filters** | • Filtering system (by room type and style)<br>• SQLite database storing design templates | • Furniture marketplace integration<br>• Payment systems or subscriptions |
| **System Design** | • Minimalist grid-based UI<br>• Modular Flask architecture | • Real-time collaborative design tools |

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Limited design dataset** | Start with curated templates (30–50 designs) |
| **Weak matching accuracy** | Use structured filters (room type, style) |
| **Scope creep** | Strict adherence to MVP features |
| **UI complexity** | Keep interface minimal and grid-based |
| **Backend integration issues** | Modular Flask architecture |
| **Low user engagement** | Add instant preview and simple UX flow |

### 💡 Value Proposition
The platform aims to streamline the interior design process by converting complex design decisions into a **simple, structured, and fast** digital experience. It enables users to instantly generate personalized interior design suggestions without requiring technical knowledge or professional expertise.

### 🚀 Key Innovation
* **Frictionless Experience:** No initial authentication required, providing immediate access to core tools.
* **Real-time Generation:** Structured design suggestions based on precise user inputs (room type, size, style).
* **Progressive Authentication:** Seamless user journey where account creation is deferred until the "Save Design" stage.

### 🏆 Competitive Advantage
* **Accessibility:** Simpler than traditional 3D tools that require advanced technical skills.
* **Efficiency:** Faster than manual design platforms or traditional consultation services.
* **Personalization:** More structured than inspiration-based apps that rely on unorganized visual browsing.
